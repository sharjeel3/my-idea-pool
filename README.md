# My Idea Pool
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run lint`

Automatically fixes formatting issues using ESLint. It reports errors that require a manual fix.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run test:coverage`

Runs tests on all files and generates a test coverage report.

Current results are as mentioned here.

File                         |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines | Uncovered Line #s |
-----------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
All files                    |    93.82 |     89.9 |    90.71 |    93.84 |                   |

Note that coverage doesn't include app index and service worker.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Use `serve -s build` in project directory to view the app. `serve` should be installed globally beforehand.
